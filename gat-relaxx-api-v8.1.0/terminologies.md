| Authorization list | The authorization list includes data carriers, for which validities can be defined specifically for certain times or certain lockers/locker groups. It can be enabled or deactivated.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Controller         | <p></p><p>There are two types of controllers:</p><ul><li><strong>Sub-controller:</strong> The electronic locks are connected to the sub-controllers. There is a sub-controller for every type of lock. The sub-controllers are controlled by a main controller or by a GAT SMART.Lock Axx 6350 or GT7 Central Locker terminal in the case of the GAT SMART.Lock 7001.</li><li><strong>Main controller:</strong> The main controllers are available in different versions. In this manual, the term "NET.Controller Main" is used for the GAT NET.Controller M 7000 and 7020 and the term "G7 Main" is used for the GC7.2000 and 3000 controllers.</li></ul>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Data carrier       | An ID credential is available in various forms, e.g., a card, wristband, or key tag. The data carriers are used to identify the users of a facility at the GANTNER devices. The identification occurs via radio frequency (RFID).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Lock / locker lock | <p></p><p>These terms are used in the manual to describe a GANTNER electronic locker lock that is used to lock lockers. There are various types of locks</p><ul><li><strong>GAT NET.Lock 70x0:</strong> Denotes a GAT NET.Lock 7000 or 7020. Connected to a GAT NET.Controller S 7000 or 7020. The identification occurs via RFID data carriers directly at the GAT NET.Lock 70x0 (or at the locker door).</li><li><strong>GAT SMART.Lock 7001:</strong> Connected to a GAT SMART.Controller S 7000 or 7020. The identification of users takes place at a central terminal (e.g., GAT SMART.Lock Axx 6350 or GT7 Central Locker) rather than directly at the locker door.</li><li><strong>GAT Lock 5020:</strong> Previous version of the GAT NET.Lock 70x0. This lock is connected to a GAT Lock Controller 5010 with identification occurring directly at the GAT Lock 5020 (or at the locker door).</li></ul>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Reservation        | Reservations can be used to reserve data carriers for specific locks. During the reservation times, the reserved lockers can only be used with the associated data carriers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Locker             | <p></p><p>The electronic locks on the lockers can be operated in various modes:</p><ul><li><strong>Free locker:</strong> A locker in free locker mode can be locked with a data carrier of a locker user and belongs to that user until it is opened again. Free lockers whose doors are open do not belong to any user.</li><li><strong>Personal locker:</strong> A locker in personal locker mode can only be locked and unlocked by a data carrier assigned to it. It belongs to the locker user as long as the locker assignment is valid.</li><li><strong>Dynamic locker:</strong> A locker in dynamic locker mode is a combination between a free locker and a personal locker. It can get occupied by locker users themselves or get assigned via the software. Only users belonging to a certain group can use these lockers, but they can freely choose between one of the lockers.</li><li><strong>Reservable lockers:</strong> A reservable locker can only be locked and unlocked by a data carrier assigned to it in the reservation, and only as long as the reservation period is active. Once the reservation period has expired, the locker is automatically set to maintenance mode and deactivated until the maintenance mode is disabled again.</li></ul> |
